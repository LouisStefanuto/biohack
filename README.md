### **Validating Drug Candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease via Collaborative Filtering**

- **Context**: “Drug development is known to be a costly and time-consuming process with high failure rates. Drug repurposing offers a solution by enabling the reuse of approved compounds to address these challenges. The outcomes of past clinical trials can be leveraged to predict novel drug-disease associations by utilizing drug- and disease-related similarities. To tackle this classification problem, collaborative filtering with implicit feedback has gained popularity, as it effectively handles large imbalances between known positive and negative associations, as well as between known and unknown associations” (Réda et al., 2024).
- **Objectives**: Identify potential drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease using collaborative filtering techniques. Emulate clinical trials in silico to validate drug candidates based on real-world data. Build an interface to display results and explore potential products or services for drug discovery in Alzheimer's disease.
- **Datasets**: [Stancofi](https://recess-eu-project.github.io/stanscofi/stanscofi_content.html#train-a-stanscofi-model-example-of-nmf-on-binary-labelled-dataset) offers two ready-to-use datasets, [Transcript](https://zenodo.org/records/7982976) and [Predict](https://zenodo.org/records/7983090), for benchmarking collaborative-filtering algorithms. Participants will also have access to the commercial version of the **National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center Uniform Database (NACC)** to emulate clinical trials for drug validation.
- **Tools**: Participants will utilize Stancofi's code and datasets to benchmark collaborative-filtering algorithms designed for drug recommender systems.
- **Encouraged Exploration**: Design an interface to display results and develop products or services that can identify drug candidates for Alzheimer's disease.
